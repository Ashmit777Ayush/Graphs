## 0_2 --> minimum turn to complete the snake ladder game
## 0_3 --> grapg with both directd and ndirected assigning direction to undirected so that graph become DAG
## 0_4 --> exploring vertex cheack reachabilty from that vertex
## 0_5 --> DFS 
## 0_6 --> connected componenets
## 0_7 --> PreVisit and PostVisit during the dfs
## 0_8 --> Cycle detection in directed graph
